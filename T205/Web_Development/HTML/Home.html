            This website “KrishiKarm” aims to provide the farmers all the information on a single platform. With all the information at a single place, it will help the farmers in choosing the right crops to be grown along with the other basic requirements like MSP, soil,etc. We have provided a unique ‘Crop Calculator’ which would help them calculate the price they should get for their produce according to the government norms. This would save them from getting cheated by the traders and earn a good livelihood. For reference, the various government policies are also included in the website.

        <b>Subsistence Farming</b>
        
        <img src="https://www.assignmentpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Subsistence-Agriculture.jpg" ALIGN="right" width="50%" />
        <p2>
            <br><br>Subsistence farming, form of farming in which nearly all of the crops or livestock raised are used to maintain the farmer and the farmer’s family, leaving little, if any, surplus for sale or trade. Preindustrial agricultural peoples throughout the world have traditionally practiced subsistence farming. Some of these peoples moved from site to site as they exhausted the soil at each location. As urban centres grew, agricultural production became more specialized and commercial farming developed, with farmers producing a sizable surplus of certain crops, which they traded for manufactured goods or sold for cash.

        <b>Plantation Agriculture</b>
        <img src="https://revision.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tea_estate-min.jpg" ALIGN="left" width="50%" height="80%"/>

        <p3>
            <br><br>Plantation agriculture is a type of commercial farming in which a single crop is grown for the entire year. This type of farming requires large amount of labour and capital. The crop production may be further processed on the farm itself where it is grown or in nearby factories or small scale industries. A transport network is essential for such farming and hence such transport network is developed.

        <p4>
            <br><br>This is a type of agriculture in which a piece of forest land is cleared mainly by tribal people by felling and burning of trees and crops are grown. After 2-3 years when the fertility of the soil in the cleared land decreases, it is abandoned and the tribe shifts to some other piece of land.
