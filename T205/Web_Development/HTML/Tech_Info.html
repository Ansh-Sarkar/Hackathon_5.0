        <!-- <b>Tech Info</b><br> -->
        Technology in agriculture can be used in different aspects of agriculture such as the application of herbicide, pesticide, fertilizer, and improved seed. Over the years, technology has proved to be extremely useful in the agricultural sector. Presently, farmers are able to grow crops in areas where they were thought could not grow, but this is only possible through agricultural biotechnology. For example, genetic engineering has made it possible to introduce certain trains into other genes of crops or animals. Such engineering boosts the resistance of the crops to pests and droughts. Through technology, farmers are in a position to electrify every process for efficiency and improved production.<br>
        There has been a limitation on how to speed the process of modern technological adoption in agriculture. This can be attributed to the fact that speeding up this concept involves a lot of knowledge and the understanding of some of the elements that influence the decision of farmers to adopt modern technology in farming. Institutional, social and economic are some of the factors that influence how fast or slow agricultural technologies are adopted. The land size, cost and benefits of technology, are some of the economic factors that determine the rate of agricultural technology adoption. Farmersâ€™ education level, age, social groupings, and gender are some of the social factors that influence the probability of a farmer to adopt modern agricultural technologies.
