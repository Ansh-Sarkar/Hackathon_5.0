            <p1>
                <br><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Wheat (Triticum spp.) occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In India, it is the second important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the total foodgrain production of the country to the extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country over the past few years.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> Wheat needs soil with a moderate amount of water holding capacity. Being very sensitive to water logging, heavy soils with poor drainage capacity is not preferred for wheat cultivation. Generally, black cotton soil with good drainage capacity and a neutral pH is preferred for cultivation. If wheat is grown as a dry crop heavy soil with a good drainage capacity is preferred. On the contrary, soil with moderate drainage capacity is preferred for wheat as irrigated crop.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> Wheat is a widely adaptable crop that can be grown in climates ranging from temperate to tropical and cold northern parts. In addition it can be cultivated anywhere from land on sea level to an altitude of up to 3300 meters. Places with a cool, moist weather for most part of the year followed by a short, dry and warm spell is most suited for wheat cultivation. This type of weather condition permits appropriate maturing and ripening of grains. However, areas with heavy rainfall, moist and warm climate are not suited for commercial wheat farming.<br>
                <!-- <br><b>Rainfall needed :-</b> If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations.<br> -->

            <p3>
                <br/><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)  is popularly known as “Jau” in Hindi  and one of the most important cereal grain crops after rice, wheat & maize. In India, this crop is cultivated as a summer crop in temperate regions & as a winter crop in tropical regions. Barley is a short growing season crop and has good drought tolerant. In olden days, Barley was mainly used as livestock feed and currently it is one of the grains used daily in human consumption (barley malt).Barley also play major role in industrial consumption.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> Barley crop can be grown on wide range of soils including saline, sodic & lighter soils. However, this crop thrives best in sandy to moderately heavy loam soils having neutral to saline reaction and medium fertility. Acidic soils are not suitable for Barley cultivation.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> Barley can be grown as summer crop as well as winter crop. This crop is mainly cultivated as Rabi season crop in India. This crop requires temperature of 12°C to 16°C at growing stage and about 30°C to 32°C at maturity. This crop is very sensitive to frost at any stage of its growth. This crop yield is highly impacted by incidence of frost at flowering stage. Barley has very good tolerance to drought conditions.<br>
                <!-- <br><b>Rainfall needed :-</b> If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations.<br> -->
                <br><b>Largest Producing states :-</b> The major production states of Barley in India are Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, West Bengal, Jammu & Kashmir, Some regions in Bihar, Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh.<br>

            <p1>
                <br><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Gram commonly known as chick pea or Bengal gram is the most important pulse crop of India. It is used for human consumption as well as for feeding to animals. Fresh green leaves are used as vegetable while straw of chickpea is an excellent fodder for cattle. The grains are also used as vegetable. India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Burma and Turkey are main gram growing countries. India ranks first in the world in respect of production.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> It can be grown on wide variety of soils. Sandy loam to clay loam is considered to be most suitable soil for gram cultivation. Soil having water logging problem are not suitable for cultivation. Saline alkaline soil are not suitable. pH in the range of 5.5 to 7 is ideal for sowing.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> It is best suited to areas having low to moderate rainfall and a mild cold weather. Excessive rains soon after sowing or at flowering stage are harmful for the crop. Severe cold is injurious, and is very harmful. It is best suited to areas having moderate rainfall of 60-90 cm per annum. It has an indeterminate growth habit, which means that the growth cycle extends as long as moisture is available.<br>
                <!-- <br><b>Rainfall needed :-</b> The average annual rainfall required by rice is 150 cm.<br> -->
