            <p1>
                <br><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Wheat (Triticum spp.) occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In India, it is the second important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the total foodgrain production of the country to the extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country over the past few years.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> Wheat needs soil with a moderate amount of water holding capacity. Being very sensitive to water logging, heavy soils with poor drainage capacity is not preferred for wheat cultivation. Generally, black cotton soil with good drainage capacity and a neutral pH is preferred for cultivation. If wheat is grown as a dry crop heavy soil with a good drainage capacity is preferred. On the contrary, soil with moderate drainage capacity is preferred for wheat as irrigated crop.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> Wheat is a widely adaptable crop that can be grown in climates ranging from temperate to tropical and cold northern parts. In addition it can be cultivated anywhere from land on sea level to an altitude of up to 3300 meters. Places with a cool, moist weather for most part of the year followed by a short, dry and warm spell is most suited for wheat cultivation. This type of weather condition permits appropriate maturing and ripening of grains. However, areas with heavy rainfall, moist and warm climate are not suited for commercial wheat farming.<br>
                <!-- <br><b>Rainfall needed :-</b> If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations.<br> -->

            <p3>
                <br/><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Bajra is popularly known as “pearl millet” and belongs to the family of Gramineae. This grain is basically originated from India or Africa. Bajra is a coarse grain crop and considered to be the poor man’s staple nourishment and suitable to cultivate in drylands.  Major Bajra production states in India are Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat. Bajra can also be used as valuable animal fodder. It is one of the major crops of China, India, South-Eastern Asia, Sudan, Pakistan, Arabia, Russia & Nigeria.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> Bajra can be grown in a wide range of soils. However, It thrives best in black cotton soils, sandy loam soils having good drainage. This crop does not prefer acidic and waterlogging soils. Avoid saturated soils for its cultivation. It grows successfully well in soils with low pH (or) high salinity. Bajra can be easily grown in regions where other cereal crops like wheat or maize would not survive.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> Bajra grows well in dry and warm climatic conditions and it’s drought-tolerant crop which requires low annual rainfall ranging between 40 cm to 60 cm. The ideal temperature for Bajra cultivation is between 20 °C to 30 °C. Moist weather is advantageous during its vegetative growth. In North India, Bajra is grown as Kharif crop and in some southern parts is grown as summer crop providing Irrigation.<br>
                <!-- <br><b>Rainfall needed :-</b> If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July). it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains. For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperature. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations.<br> -->

            <p1>
                <br><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Rice is the most important food crop of India covering about one-fourth of the total cropped area and providing food to about half of the Indian population.
                This is the staple food of the people living in the eastern and the southern parts of the country, particularly in the areas having over 150 cm annual rainfall. There are about 10,000 varieties of rice in the world out of which about 4,000 are grown in India.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> Rice can be grown on a variety of soils including silts, loams and gravels and can tolerate acidic as well as alkaline soils. However, deep fertile clayey or loamy soils which can be easily puddled into mud and develop cracks on drying are considered ideal for raising this crop.<br>
                <br>Such soil requirements make it dominantly a crop of river valleys, flood plains, deltas and coastal plains and a dominant crop there.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> Rice is grown under varying conditions in India from 8° to 25° N latitude and from sea level to about 2,500 metre altitude. It is a tropical plant and requires high heat and high humidity for its successful growth. The temperature should be fairly high at mean monthly of 24°C. It should be 20°- 22°C at the time of sowing, 23°-25°C during growth and 25°-30°C at the harvesting time.<br>
                <br><b>Rainfall needed :-</b> The average annual rainfall required by rice is 150 cm.<br>
                <br><b>Largest Producing states :-</b> West Bengal is the largest producer of rice in India, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.<br>

            <b>Maize</b>
            
            <img src="../Data/Maize.jpg" ALIGN="left" width="45%" />
            <p3>
                <br/><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Maize can be grown as a single crop in a year or 2-3 crops in the same year because both short and long duration varieties of the crops are available. In areas where maize is grown as a mixed crop, crops that are of short variety are grown between the tall maize plants. When short duration variety of maize is cultivated, it is generally rotated with crops like potatoes, beans, chillies, chrysanthemum, onions, etc. Some farmers also grow ragi although it is also a cereal crop. In places like Uttar Pradesh, where maize is grown as a field crop, carrots or wheat are grown as subordinate crop.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> A soil with pH of 5.5 to 7.0 and a good drainage capacity is preferred for maize cultivation. Loamy sand, black soil and even clayey loam is suitable for maize. Both red soil and alluvial are said to be optimal for growing maize.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> Maize cannot tolerate frost and hence it is a Kharif crop sown just before the monsoons arrive in India. It requires about 70 mm of rainfall. Alternate spells of sunshine and rainfall is optimal for maize production. It can tolerate temperature up to 35⁰C.<br>
                <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainfall needed :-</b> Maize is both sensitive to less water and more water. Hence a well-drained soil that lets &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water drain off while holding back adequate amount of moisture is preferred.

                <br><br><b>About the crop :-</b>  Peanut or groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), is a species in the legume or "bean" family. The peanut was probably first domesticated and cultivated in the valleys of Paraguay. It is an annual herbaceous plant growing 30 to 50 cm (1.0 to 1.6 ft) tall. The leaves are opposite, pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet), each leaflet 1 to 7 cm (? to 2 inch) long and 1 to 3 cm (? to 1 inch) broad.<br>
                <br><b>Soil required for the crop :-</b> Groundnut does well in the light-textured, loose, friable, well-drained, and sandy and sandy loam soils which facilitates easy penetration of pegs and their development along with harvesting. Clay and heavy soils are not recommended for this crop as they interfere in penetration of pegs and make harvesting very difficult.<br>
                <br><b>Weather conditions & Temperature needed :-</b> It is a tropical plant, which requires a long and warm growing season. It thrives well in areas that receive an average rainfall of 50 to 125 cm during the growing season, an abundance of sunshine and relatively with warm temperatures.<br>
